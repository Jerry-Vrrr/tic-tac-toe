 ## Abstract
 Tic-Snack-Toe is a play on the classic children's game of tic-tac-toe that dates back to around 1300BC from where such game boards have been found etched into stone and clay. It's like that, but with fun snacks and snazzy 8-bit music jams. For more info on the origins and history of this timeless game, visit [Tic-Tac-Toe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tic-tac-toe).

##### If all squares are filled, but there is no winner, the game will result in a tie and no points will be awarded. When a win or tie occurs, the game will automatically clear, allowing the next round to begin.
