## Project Roadmap:
1. The user must include inputs in the "Title" and "Body" sections.


2. When a user clicks the Save Button, the new idea card will appear on the webpage.



3. When a user clicks the delete button on the new idea card, the card will delete from view.



4. When a user clicks the "favorite" star, the star will show as a different color to display that the card has been favorited.


## Future Additions:
1. When the user clicks the show starred ideas button, they will see all their favorited idea cards.
2. The user can then toggle between their favorite ideas and all other ideas.
3. The user should be able to use the search bar to filter ideas.
