# tic-tac-toe
[Project Spec](https://frontend.turing.edu/projects/module-1/tic-tac-toe-solo.html)

 ## Description
 Tic-Snack-Toe is a play on the classic children's game of tic-tac-toe that dates back to around 1300BC from where such game boards have been found etched into stone and clay. It's like that, but with fun snacks and snazzy 8-bit music jams. For more info on the origins and history of this timeless game, visit [Tic-Tac-Toe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tic-tac-toe).

 * Understand the difference between the data model and how the data is displayed on the DOM
 * Iterate through/filter DOM elements using for loops
 * Use problem solving process to break down large problems in order to be able to solve things step by step.
 * Additional Goals:
  * Demonstrate and practice advanced CSS and CSS animations
  * Adding background music to web pages

##### The game board will then be revealed and the game's music score will play in the background automatically.

##### This is a 2 player game. A player can connect 3 hamburgers or hotdogs in a row, column or diagonally to win. Your wins will be updated in the player sections under the player image.

##### If all squares are filled, but there is no winner, the game will result in a tie and no points will be awarded. When a win or tie occurs, the game will automatically clear, allowing the next round to begin.
